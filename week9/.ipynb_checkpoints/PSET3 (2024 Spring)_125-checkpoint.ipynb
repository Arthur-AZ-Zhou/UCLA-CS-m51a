    "\n",
    "**3. You can make three submission attempts. We do not count submissions detected to have tampered with notebook cells that prevent grading (e.g. if there are more or fewer cells than expected or there is a match of cell type). For the first attempt, the Autograder will only perform some basic sanity checks on the basic format of your answer and return a score of 0. It will, however, not check or provide feedback on the correctness of your answer. For example, if the answer has to be a list of base-10 integers, then the sanity check will check whether you indeed provided10 a list of base-10 integers. Likewise, if the answer asks for a logic expression, the sanity check will check whether your answer is indeed a valid logic expression (however, it will not check whether the variable names used are correct). For the second and third attempts, the Autograder will also report whether your answer is correct or not, but it will not tell you what the correct answer is or why your answer is wrong.**\n",

    "**4. If we discover a bug in the Autograder, we will compensate the impacted students with an extra attempt only for the impacted question. For other questions unaffected by the bug, the score the end of third attempt will be used.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Please do not edit, move, or delete any of the cells. You must only write in the cells provided for your answers while adhering strictly to the format requirements. Otherwise, the Autograder cannot grade, and even though we do not count the attempt, it will cause you needless panic.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Most problems/subproblems will be auto-graded, and it is critically important that you strictly adhere to the formatting requirements for the answers. A few will be graded manually, and there you are allowed free-form text, either plain text or in Markdown format.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. After every problem or subproblem, we have provided a cell where you can optionally provide a brief explanation of your solution approach. By default, we will not grade the explanation but use it if your answer is marked wrong by the autograder or the human grader, and you request a regrade. No regrade request will be entertained unless an explanation of how you derived your answer is provided. The explanation cells can accept text in Markdown format.**"
