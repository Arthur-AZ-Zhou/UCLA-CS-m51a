    "> ### Version History:\n",
    "> - 1.0: initial release\n",
    "> - 1.1: fixed ordering of tasks and some typos\n",
    "> ### Instructions:\n",
    "> 1. You should download your personalized Logisim starter files by following the link provided on Piazza, which will take you to a spreadsheet with linke to a zip file containing your personalized starter files.\n",
    "> 1. This design assignment must be done individually, subject to the following collaboration policy with other students. However, see the next bullet for an option to solve a problem jointly for reduced credit.\n",
    ">    * Allowed Collaboration:\n",
    ">        - Discuss how to interpret a problem’s specification\n",
    ">        - Discuss how to approach the problem in general terms\n",
    ">        - Share testing strategy and sets of test inputs/outputs\n",
    ">        - Share design performance data\n",
    ">    * Anything not stated above is disallowed and would be treated as an honor code violation.\n",
    "> 1. As an alternative to doing the problems individually, you can choose to do any problem jointly with one other student. If so, you must submit that problem as a team (Gradescope allows that). Each student will get 80% of the post-normalization score for the problem in such a case. Doing a problem jointly but failing to submit it as a team and declaring it in the report will result in a zero score on that problem. Moreover, such an action will be treated as cheating and reported as an honor code violation.\n",
    "> 1. **Late Submission:**  The standard course policy for late submissions and days applies.\n",
    "> 1. **Submission Procedure:** You will upload several items to Gradescope: (i) This notebook after filling out the answer cells, and (ii) Design files separately for each task. When you upload design files to Gradescope, the autograder will do some basic sanity checks and report any missing files but not run any actual tests. It is your responsibility to devise test cases to test your circuit.\n",
    "> 1. Please comply with all the instructions, as failure to do so can prevent Autograder from testing your design. If we have to grade manually because your failure to comply with instructions (e.g., file names, pin naming, etc.) required us to fix, we will scale your score down by 20% where the problem occurs. Note that this does not apply to design bugs—there is no manual grading.\n",
    "> 1. **Logisim:**\n",
    ">    - You must use the version of Logisim made available for download on Piazza (Version 3.8.0).\n",
    ">    - As you edit in Logisim, save frequently and make backup copies of your design file.\n",
    ">    - We will grade using the top-level circuit (we almost always label it as DUT), but you are free to create additional sub-circuits you use in DUT.\n",
    ">    - We highly recommend using Logisim’s tunnels, which make your circuit cleaner and allow for easier debugging. Tunnels allow you to move a value from one part of the circuit to another without having to drag a wire all the way across. You can create tunnels for all the inputs and their complements. Instead of hooking up the inputs directly to the gates, you can hook up using tunnels.\n",
    ">    - Do not rename or move any input or output pins or add any additional pins. Doing so will in all likelihood cause the Autograder to fail and result in points being deducted (see below).\n",
    ">    - Testing is as critical as design; in particular, make sure to test for edge cases. For manual testing, you can use the hand tool and click on the input pins to change their values, which will propagate to the rest of the circuit. You can reset the simulation back to the start with Ctrl-R to test again after you make changes. You can also use the Test Vector feature to test your circuit automatically.\n",
    ">    - The Test Vector feature in Logisim Evolution allows you to test your combinational circuit against the expected output. You can read more about the Test Vector feature and how to use it in the Logisim Evolution User's Guide. You are also free to exchange test vector files or collaboratively create them with other students in the class.\n",
    ">    - You must use designs relying only on gates permitted for each problem. Failure to do so will result in a zero score. This is a hard requirement.\n",
    ">    - Save frequently and commit frequently! Try to save your code in Logisim every 5 minutes or so, and commit every time you produce a new feature, even if it is small.\n",
    "> 1. Cost of Logisim Modules (not all of these may be needed or allowed in a problem)\n",
    ">    - $w$-bitwidth NOT: $2 \\times w$\n",
    ">    - $w$-bitwidth NAND with $n$ inputs: $2 \\times w \\times n$\n",
    ">    - $w$-bitwidth NOR with $n$ inputs: $2 \\times w \\times n$\n",
    ">    - $w$-bitwidth AND with $n$ inputs: $2 \\times w \\times (n+1)$\n",
    ">    - $w$-bitwidth OR with $n$ inputs: $2 \\times w \\times (n+1)$\n",
    ">    - $w$-bitwidth XOR with $2$ inputs: $2 \\times 12 \\times w$\n",
    ">    - $w$-bitwidth XNOR with $2$ inputs: $2 \\times 12 \\times w$\n",
    ">    - D Flip-Flop: $18$\n",
    ">    - T Flip-Flop: $32$\n",
    ">    - $w$-bitwidth Register: $20 \\times w$\n",
    ">    - $w$-bitwidth Adder, Subtractor, Comparator: $28 \\times w$\n",
    ">    - $w$-bitwidth Multiplier: $28 \\times w^2$\n",
    ">    - $w$-bitwidth $2^s$-to-$1$ Multiplexer: $6 \\times w \\times 2^s + 2^s + (s>1\\;?\\;2 \\times s \\times 2^s : 0)$\n",
    ">      - For a $w$-bitwidth 2-to-1  Multiplexer, the cost expression simplifies to $12 \\times w + 2$\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "> 1. **gv2fsm Tool:**\n",
    ">    - When creating an FSM, you may benefit significantly from using a tool called gv2fsm, which I have written as a Google Colab Notebook. It takes as input an FSM state diagram written using a language called Graphviz that is used to draw graphs (the tool imposes some conventions on top of Graphviz to allow FSM state diagrams to be specified) and then validates them for many common errors and then produces a Logisim design that can be used for testing (but it uses components that we don’t allow - so you can’t use it as your solution).\n",
    "-->\n",
    "> 1.  After every problem or subproblem, we have provided a cell where you can optionally provide a brief explanation of your solution approach. By default, we will not grade the explanation but use it if the autograder or the human grader marks your answer wrong and you request a regrade. No regrade request will be entertained unless an explanation of how you derived your answer is provided. The explanation cells can accept text in Markdown format."

However, unfortunately, Logisim does not allow for more than 64-bit inputs, and so we have split the output B into an upper half B_UPPER\\[63:0\\] (corresponding to bits B\\[127:64\\]) and a lower half  B_LOWER\\[63:0\\] (corresponding to bits B\\[63:0\\]).

    "The system that you are designing does smart multiplexing of camera outputs in a security system. Specifically, the system has eight cameras that provide eight 2-bit signals S0\\[7:0\\], S1\\[7:0\\], S2\\[7:0\\], S3\\[7:0\\], S4\\[7:0\\], S5\\[7:0\\], S6\\[7:0\\], and S7\\[7:0\\] to your system. Camera #0 has the highest priority, and camera #7 has the lowest priority. The 2-bit output from a camera indicates whether the camera is not seeing any object (00) or seeing one of three types of objects (01 = human, 10 = animal, 11 = vehicle).\n",
