Let us write the value of this number as $w_4b_4+w_3b_3+w_2b_2+w_1b_1+w_0b_0$ where $w_4$, $w_3$, $w_2$, $w_1$, and $w_0$ can be viewed as weights given to the corresponding bit positions. What values of the weights will yield the numeric value of the number? You must get all five weights correct to get credit. Please provide your answer as a list of the five base-10 integer weights in the order $w_4$, $w_3$, $w_2$, $w_1$, and $w_0$.

To represent signed numbers in this computer, one can generalize the concept of two's complement representation that we saw for base-2 to three's complement in base-3. In base-2, to negate a _n_-bit number $x$, we took its two's complement which was obtained by subtracting $x$ from the largest possible unsigned _n_-bit number (all 1's) and then adding 1, or equivalent computing $2^n-x$.

You answer should be accurate to within 0.1% of the real value, although you should be able to express the exact value easily. E.g., your answer may be 31.40625, or it may be 3.140625E1."
