To represent signed numbers in this computer, one can generalize the concept of two's complement representation that we saw for base-2 to three's complement in base-3. In base-2, to negate a _n_-bit number $x$, we took its two's complement which was obtained by subtracting $x$ from the largest possible unsigned _n_-bit number (all 1's) and then adding 1, or equivalent computing $2^n-x$.

    "We need to fine the maximum of both numbers and add them to be able to ensure that we have the proper amount of bits that there will be no overflow. The fractional part is actually relatively easy enough, as we only need number of bits for the fractional part that has the most bits. So we take the max of f1 and f2 to find the total number of bits we need for the fraction. As for the integer part, the max you can get for either number is 2^n1 - 1 and 2^n2 - 1. We take the ceiling of the log of the sum of these two values to get the maximum number of bits we need to represent the whole part. So the total number of bits is the ceiling of log2 of (2^n1 - 1) + (2^n2 - 1) + max(f1, f2)"

    "\n",
    "General purpose programming languages have 32-bit and 64-bit floating point numbers (e.g., float and double in C/C++) to represent real values. However as they are an overkill for many specialized applications such as graphics, machine learning, sensor processing, embedded computing, etc., floating point representations have emerged that use fewer bits. One such format is _bfloat16_ (brain floating point) was developed by Google's AI research group Google Brain for AI and machine learning. Many CPUs, GPUs, and AI processors, support it. \n",
    "\n",

Moreover values of all 0s or all 1s in the exponent field are reserved to represent special numbers. So for example if E = 00000001, then that means exponent is 1-127 = -126, and if E = 11111110 then exponent is 254-127 = 127.\n",
    "* Mantissa is assumed to be of the form (1 + a 7-bit fraction), and the 7-bit field F encodes the bits in fractional part of the mantissa.\n",
